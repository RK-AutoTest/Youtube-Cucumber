# Youtube-Cucumber
This project serves as a practice exercise for Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver. It incorporates a framework that includes Maven for project management, the Page Object Model (POM) for maintaining a structured test framework, Selenium WebDriver for web automation, and Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) style test scenarios.

The primary objective of this project is to automate some basic tests for various functionalities. The tests performed include:

Page Title Verification:
The project verifies the page title of the web application being tested. It ensures that the correct page title is displayed, validating the navigation and proper loading of the web page.

YouTube Reels Section Testing:
The project tests the functionality of the reels section on YouTube. It simulates user actions by clicking the next button twice, each time with a waiting time of 4000ms, and then clicks the previous button to return to the first reel. This test ensures that the navigation and interaction with the reels section work as expected.

Search Button Functionality Testing:
The project verifies the functionality of the search button. It tests the search feature by entering a search query and checking if the expected results are displayed. This test ensures that the search functionality works correctly, enabling users to find relevant content.

Voice Search Button and Pop-up Verification:
The project tests the voice search button functionality and checks if the pop-up voice is displayed. It verifies that the voice search button triggers the expected behavior and validates if the pop-up voice element appears as intended.

Through these automated tests, the project provides hands-on practice in using Cucumber with Selenium WebDriver to validate different functionalities of the web application. The project's focus is to enhance skills in writing automated test scenarios, implementing test frameworks, and executing end-to-end tests using industry-standard tools and practices.
